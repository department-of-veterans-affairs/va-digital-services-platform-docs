title: Steps for Defining Your Project
label: Project Introduction
---
VA’s mission is to build products that make things easier for everyone: Veterans, VSOs, VA employees, VA Offices, and more. Start by understanding the target user’s challenges and the current journey they take to achieve their goals. By combining those discovery findings with an understanding of the business requirements you'll be on the optimal path for developing a solution that best serves all parties.

In this section you'll find the steps for taking your project from an idea and transforming it into an actionable plan for your team:
  1. [Understand your users' needs](./understanding-user-needs)
  1. [Validate your hypothesis through user research](./validating-hypotheses-with-research)
  1. [Transforming research insights in a project plan](./from-insights-to-a-project-plan)
  1. [Kickoff your project by meeting with (X)](./kickoff-your-project)
  1. [Set up your workflow](./set-up-your-workflow)

We recommend organizing the various aspects of your project with a [Product Outline](/docs/resources/templates/product-outline). It's a living document that you can use to capture important information and key decisions during the different phases of your product’s life cycle.


#### Additional Resources:

- [Draft personas, a problem statement, and assumptions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-digital-services-platform-docs/blob/rr-edits/content/03-defining-the-project/01-understanding-user-needs.md): a guide to setting yourself up for Discovery, by documenting who your target users are, and what you believe to be true about their challenges and needs.
- [Create a Product Outline](/): a living document that should become more robust as you learn more about uers and refine the product requirements. You can start it in this phase by filling in your problem statement and assumptions, and can come back to refine it and add more information at the end of Discovery when you've learned more.
- [Document your Team Composition](/): a template with recommendations for what types of roles to include on your team to ensure you have the appropriate implementation and validation resources.
- [Create a Product Charter](/): an alignment document whose purpose is to make sure your general solution approach is agreed upon by all stakeholders -- without going to deep into solution detail, since that will be further defined after Discovery.
- [Choose a research method](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/): a list of 18F's recommended Discovery methods. Browse to find a tactic that suits your projects needs, as well as instructions for how to perform that activity.
- [Draft a research plan](/): a guide for thinking through what you want to validate and learn in this research, so you're prepared to make the most of your research sessions.
- [Recruit users](/): a guide for the kinds of channels and messaging to use when looking for Veterans, their family members, VSOs, or other potential users to talk to.
- [Talk with users and stakeholders](/): tips on how to conduct research sessions.
- [Synthesize your findings](/): a template for presenting your findings in a way that's relevant for those making product or feature decisions.
