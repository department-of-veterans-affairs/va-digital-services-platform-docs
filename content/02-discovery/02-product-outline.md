Now that your team has a strong understanding of your usersâ€™ needs, you can combine those insights with the your organization's business requirements to define project goals.

A great way to aggregate your findings, assumptions, constraints and MVP plan together is in a document called a **Product Outline**. This document serves as a single source of truth for your team throughout your project and is meant to be continuously updated as your project evolves.

With those items documented it is much easier to map out your team's MVP approach and share your intentions with the VA group so we can help you move your initiative forward.

If you haven't already started a product outline during the Project Introduction, no worries; we ask that you start with a few basics:

#### Problem Statement
 Veterans have trouble applying for dependent benefits. Currently the only way they can apply is with paper form that they have to mail in. This leads to a lot of missing data that makes processing their applications difficult and they often have to wait a long time to receive a declaration.

#### Solution Goals
Our goal is to offer a way for to submit the 686 Dependents form on their computer or smartphone and reduce the amount of applications that come in with incomplete data.

#### Business Requirements
Veterans must be able to upload supporting documents in certain scenarios to support their dependent claim.

#### Research Insights
Veterans have indicated that one of most difficult parts of the 686 Form is gathering information on their Spouse's previous marriages. In addition, they don't understand why this information is relevant when applying to declare a dependent.

#### Solution Approach
We plan on building a digital form with React.js on the frontend and a backend submission connection to the Central Mail API. This will enable users to quickly submit the 686 form with supporting documentation on Vets.gov. We're shooting to launch a first version (MVP) of this form on June 1st, 2018.

#### Key Performance Indicators
- Decrease the time it takes for a user to get a dependents declaration
- Decrease the number of applications that are received with incomplete data
- Increase the number applications submitted
