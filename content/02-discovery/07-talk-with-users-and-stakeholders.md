## Listening
Solving the problems people actually have, is critical to success. Projects often come out of someone’s passion to improve services. But that perspective can omit important factors. It's important to really poke at the edges of the idea to find trouble spots early in the process.

Talk to people on both sides of the equation. From the business side:
  - What do you need to from Veterans to help them?
  - What are common errors you see people make that slow or threaten delivery of benefits? What is working well?
  - What technical or policy issues are a challenge? Are there work-arounds that might need to adjust with new approaches?

And from the Veteran side:
  - What parts of the process are frustrating or painful?
  - What parts are working well?

## Running research sessions
You need at least two people to run a research session. One person will facilitate the conversation and the other person is a designated note taker. This frees the facilitator up to concentrate on the conversation and follow it wherever it leads without trying to scribble notes along the way. Sessions can be 30 minutes or longer. More than 60 is not recommended. If meeting in person, ideally you can see the person where they typically perform the task you are investigating. But often times the sessions are virtual. We use video conferencing software that lets us share our screens with the participant.
- Reassure the participant that you are testing software, not them
- We don’t want to steer the participant, but being friendly is fine!
- We try not to schedule sessions back to back, everyone needs a break. More than a couple a day can be overwhelming.
