## Figure out what you are looking to learn
This is a brainstorming session where your team should come up with questions that you are looking to understand. Here are some examples of questions that may come out of this exercise:
- Do Veterans understand the eligibility requirements for this VA benefit?
- What are the most difficult parts of this application process that users get stuck on?

Try using this [Planning template](../resources/templates/planning-template) to drive the conversation during your brainstorming session.


## Creating a conversation guide
A conversation guide is used by a facilitator to organize a research or feedback session. It is a written guide, more speaker notes than a script, but a way to make sure all important questions get answered.
- Pre-plan questions to ask them without leading the participant to a desired outcome
- Prioritizes and sharpens questions.
- Provides consistency across sessions with different facilitators
