It’s important to hear from a representative sample of your constituency. Aim to talk to people across the full range of age, ethnicity, gender, geography, branches, service eras, and expertise that you’d expect to find in people using the tools you’re building. Consider recruiting participants in person at Veteran focused events, through VSO relationships, and even just using your personal networks via social media.

It is very helpful to have blurbs that are written with the various channels in mind. Short bites for social media, longer pieces for email. We have also made cards that we can hand out with contact details participants can use to ask about signing up for sessions. Here is an example of an email that you can use for recruiting users to interview
>Hi [PARTICIPANT NAME], <br><br>
>Hope you've been well! <br><br>
>Thanks so much again for your interest in giving us feedback on the online tools we're building for Veterans. We're scheduling one-on-one virtual meetings [DATES] - would you like to participate? <br><br>
>Please answer the questions below, and if it's a good fit, I'll email you back to get everything scheduled. As a thank you for participating we'll ask if we can send you a $25 gift card at the end. <br><br>
>1. Will you have access to a computer, laptop, or tablet during the session? If not, we won't be able to run the virtual meeting.
>2. [ANY QUESTIONS THAT'LL HELP IDENTIFY WHETHER THEY'RE A GOOD MATCH FOR THIS TYPE OF SESSION. COULD PUT A LINK TO A WUFOO FORM HERE FOR COHORTS SEGMENTING PURPOSES.]
>3. Are you available at any of these times? <br><br>
>Thanks, and hope to talk with you soon! <br><br>
>[SIGNATURE]

**Keep in mind that some communities can be more suspicious than others. A @va.gov email address or some personal vouching goes a long way. If you need any help recruiting, our team may be able to help you find users to interview. Please contact us at user_research@va.gov.**
