## Gathering findings and sharing with teammates
Once the research sessions are done, it’s effective to meet as a group and sift through the notes to extract common themes. Consider behavior patterns, questions asked and note areas of frustration that users exhibit during their experience.

Synthesize the results of your user research sessions into a readout document to make it easier to communicate to people that weren’t there. A readout could be a written document, slide deck, or something else entirely, but it should be in a format that will be easy to use and share within your organization.
