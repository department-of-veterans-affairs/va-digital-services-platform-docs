title: Discovering and Validating Assumed User and VA Needs
label: Discovery Intro
---
In this phase, the goal is to connect directly with real potential users and stakeholders to validate your assumptions on what you *think* people will find valuable, what kind of product you *think* will solve their main problems.

Remember to stay open to having your hypotheses proven wrong. Changing approach at this phase is much easier than after a product is live.

### Process:
1. [Draft personas, a problem statement, and assumptions](./problem-statements-and-assumptions): set yourself up for Discovery by documenting who your target users are, and what you believe to be true about their challenges and needs.
1. [Create a Product Outline](./product-outline): start filling in your problem statement and assumptions, and come back to refine additional product information at the end of Discovery when you've learn from users and stakeholders, and have a better idea of what to build.
1. <a href='https://methods.18f.gov/discover/' target="blank">Choose a research method</a>: browse 18F's recommended Discovery methods to find a tactic that suits your projects needs, as well as instructions for how to perform that activity.
1. [Draft a research plan](./draft-research-plan): think through what you want to validate and learn in this research, so you're prepared to make the most of your research sessions.
1. [Recruit users](./recruit-users): decide what channels and messaging to use when looking for Veterans, their family members, VSOs, or other potential users to talk to.
1. [Talk with users and stakeholders](./talk-with-users-and-stakeholders): conduct research sessions.
1. [Synthesize your discovery findings](./synthesize-your-findings): present your findings in a way that's relevant for those making product or feature decisions.
1. [Rudimentary technical review](./rudimentary-technical-review): initially explore existing APIs and services to understand the technical landscape.
1. [Start thinking through ATO requirements](../deploy-your-app/ato)

By the way, as soon as you feel like you have a good understanding of your users needs, you can start on [defining and designing activities](../define-and-design/define-and-design-introduction). It's ok and natural for these phases to overlap and inform each other.

<!-- Team Composition (step3) and Product Charter (step4) are omitted for now because they have no content-->
<!-- 1. [Document your team composition](./team-composition): define your team composition and roles to ensure you have the appropriate implementation and validation resources.
1. [Create a Product Charter](./product-charter): make sure your general solution approach is agreed upon by all stakeholders -- without going to deep into solution detail, since that will be further defined after Discovery. -->
