## Digram product flows
- Wire frame out the entire flow of the benefit. How do Veterans move from screen to screen of the product?
- What conditional logic will affect that flow?
- What external systems will be touched, and when?
- Are there points where people will move in and out of your product? Are there any pauses or waiting involved?
- How are notifications handled?
- What error states can you anticipate?

### Examples
- [Application process flow]()


## Establish IA by outlining product
- Break flow up into screens. What interactions make sense to be grouped together?
- What are the states for each screen?
- Is there contextual help you can offer to clarify decisions?
- Where do errors or alerts show up?

### Examples

This is a good time to start looking at the <a href="https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/design-system/" target="blank">Vets.gov Design System</a> and looking around for ways that similar situations are being addressed elsewhere on Vets.gov. Donâ€™t unnecessarily reinvent the wheel.
