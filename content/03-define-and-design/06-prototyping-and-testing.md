title: Prototyping Your Designs for Effective Feedback
label: Prototyping & Testing
---
It’s important to validate solutions with the people who will use them before we launch. By testing prototypes before we fully develop solutions, we catch and avoid errors that would be much more costly to fix later.

We take different approaches depending on the complexity of the situation. We don’t have a hard and fast rule for how this works, just that it is done.

## Building Prototypes
- Prototyping technique should balance speed with quality of feedback you can get
  - Sometimes you can do an outline and go straight to code
  - Sometimes there are novel patterns that need more fidelity to narrow options before code makes sense
    - If we are doing something totally new, we do more exploration before moving forward
  - We try to avoid sprawling hi-fidelity comps
    - They are brittle, and keeping them current is extra work
    - Branching logic is more practical to prototype in code
    - Work done in code is more likely to be reusable
    - Live code allows real Veteran entered data to test assumptions, rather than pretty demo data
- Start with small screens
  - Not every process “feels” like a mobile activity, but some folks really only have ready access to the internet through phones
  - The constraint is helpful in keeping interactions simple
- Negotiate with your team to find the right approach

## Testing your ideas
Get prototypes in front of a representative sample of your audience and take notes. There is a ton of great writing on usability feedback sessions.
- This can be in person, or remote. We’ve gotten great feedback in both scenarios.
- Decide ahead of time what questions you are trying to answer and plan the conversation to expose those answers.
- Make sure you get your questions covered, but don’t be afraid to chase tangents. Sometimes they end up in interesting places

Get the whole team involved. Design, development, and copy folks all have their own perspective and will pick out different elements of the feedback. It also helps to socialize the feedback if more people had direct exposure. It is also usually really rewarding to hear Veteran voices talk about your work.

You are going to be tempted to immediately jump to solutions for problems that come up when Veterans use your prototype. Hold off until you’ve gotten all the feedback together and sifted through it.
