### Keep it simple
There is a lot of unavoidable complexity in VA policy and procedure, we endeavor not to add to it. This manifests in a few ways:
- Limit the number of decisions that a Veteran needs to make in one screen. We usually try to keep the number of questions under five. Two or three is even better.
- Find out what questions we need to ask. Sometimes we will “add” a question to simplify things. Where a paper form might have a multicolumn table to ask questions about dependents, we will ask if they have any dependents. If the answer is no, we skip the table entirely. Similar for any fields that match an “if yes, please explain” pattern.
- Prefer simplicity over flexibility. It can feel helpful to give Veterans multiple ways or places to enter data. But this increases complexity and can end up being more confusing (and brittle) than reassuring.
- Minimize the number of fields. Social Security numbers and phone numbers are one field. We deal with dashes and other formatting on the back end.
- Minimize obfuscation. We don’t do the •••••••••• thing with SSN. Let people see the data they are entering.

### Reduce data entry
Everyone is frustrated having to enter data repeatedly, especially if it is stuff that VA should already know. Once someone is signed in, we should do everything we can to reduce this.
- Prefill data. We get as much data from VA systems as we can. If VA already knows it, we present it for review and help Veterans update if necessary.
- Embed small forms. If there is a small second form involved, we add the unique questions conditionally. We fill the common stuff (name, date of birth, etc.) in from the data we’ve already collected and submit both forms if necessary.
- Save in progress. Any Vets.gov form can save progress so that a Veteran who is interrupted can pick up again later.

### Limit required fields
- We work with stakeholders to make sure that we are only collecting data that we _need_ to be able to deliver a benefit.

### Digital signatures
Every paper form has at least one signature line. So far, the agreement to terms and submission of form has been stand in for a literal signature. We have not yet dealt with multi-party signatures.

### Being specific
We try not to assume too much context. Most people are not expert in VA benefits. In situations where we are collecting similar information about multiple parties (e.g. contact details) we clearly level at both the chunk and field level where practical. This is especially helpful to folks with memory issues (common in cases of TBI). This approach can be aided by building a list of people first, and then looping through the questions for each.
