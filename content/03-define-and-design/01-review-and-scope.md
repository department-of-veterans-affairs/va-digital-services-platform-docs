title: Review Discovery Findings and Scope Project
label: Review & Scope
---
Get the entire team together to review the findings of the discovery phase. Combine the user experience findings with technical discovery to get a handle on the smallest useful product that we can deliver on Vets.gov. It should be big enough to be impactful, but small enough that we can deliver it quickly and get feedback before moving on to a larger solution.

Creating epics and tickets will help your team break down your MVP goal into actionable tasks. List the items that are necessary for Version 1 and note the changes that can come later on as enhancements.

Further, it's important for your team establish a workflow to make sure you stay on track, while avoiding unnecessary scope creep. If your team already has an established workflow, feel free to skip to the [next section](./diagram-and-outline). If your looking to leverage a new workflow for your project - below you'll find some resources for setting one up.

**Note** - Things to pay attention to:
- External integration points may have their own timetables.
- Are there policy constraints that need to be explored for flexibility?

## Agile Resources
At Vets.gov we use a Agile Software Development process and measure our work in two week sprints. If you'd like to learn more about planning agile sprints checkout [18f's agile guide](https://lean-product-design.18f.gov/9-plan-sprint-agile/).

 The Vets.gov agile workflow is managed using Github and a Github integration called [Zenhub](https://zenhub.com) that turns Github issues into a project board. If you're interested in learning more about using Zenhub as a workflow management tool - here is a [Zenhub Onboarding Guide](/va-digital-services-platform-docs/assets/define/templates/zenhub_onboarding.pdf) and a [Zenhub Project Management Guide](/va-digital-services-platform-docs/assets/define/templates/zenhub_project_management.pdf).

 If you have any questions about setting up Zenhub, contact Ryan at ryan.luu@adhocteam.us.
