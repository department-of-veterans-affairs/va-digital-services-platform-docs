## Need to Know vs. Nice to Know
Need-to-know information answers specific questions or helps solve the user’s problems. [Always put this information first](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/structure-the-content/) — in the material as a whole and within sections. Key information that is buried with less crucial information can confuse users, or they might miss it altogether.

Save nice-to-know information for later on, or even better, cut it if it doesn’t help your audience understand or act on your main message. If you need to include background information, keep it brief.

## Calls to Action
When readers understand what action to take and how to take it, they’re more likely to act. Think about what action you want the reader to take:
- State the action clearly at or near the beginning of the page.
- Make it easy for the reader to take action.
- Briefly note the benefit of taking the action.

In the after example below, the heading is now a clear call to action, and the link to complete the action is more prominent. Always put the call to action early. If it’s later in the material — even just a few sentences — the user may never get to it.

If you don’t pay your bill within 30 days, we’ll add a penalty (extra charge) to your next bill. The penalty is an extra 6% of what you owe.

For example, if you had a bill of $200 and didn’t pay it within 30 days, your next bill would be for $212 (the original amount plus an extra 6%).
