## Accordions and Jump to section

When the user has a choice to make on a page to find content relevant to them, we either use accordions to hide extraneous information until the user makes a choice, or give them the option to jump to another area of the page. The purpose of this is to avoid having pages that are so long as to be overwhelming in the volume of content, especially content not relevant to the user. See the [Fully Developed Claim](https://www.vets.gov/pension/apply/fully-developed-claim/) page in our Pension section for an example of accordions. See the [About VA Health Care Coverage](https://www.vets.gov/health-care/about-va-health-care/) page in our Health Care section for an example of jump links within a page.

### Accordions

At the end of every file in which thereâ€™s an accordion, we need to add this:
<script src="https://standards.usa.gov/assets/js/vendor/uswds.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>


## Yellow warning call-out box with drop-down

When we have related information that's important to the user but not the focus of the page, we use a yellow box with a drop-down that's triggered by a link in the yellow box. See the [Mental Health](https://www.vets.gov/health-care/health-conditions/mental-health/) page in our Health Care section.

## Home page banner

The format should be:
- Sentence-style capping for title of banner
- One or two lines of text as the body text of the banner.
- As needed, a link at the end of the body text for where to get more information.
