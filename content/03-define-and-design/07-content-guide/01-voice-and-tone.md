**Voice** is the style, or personality, of a communication. The vets.gov voice should be consistent across all our communications. The vets.gov voice is direct, transparent, dedicated, and human. It’s that of a trusted advocate — ready with information, advice, and updates.

Direct        | Transparent        | Dedicated          | Human
--------------| -------------------| -------------------| ---------
confident     | clear              | consistent         | accessible
decisive      | open               | supportive         | friendly
honest        | informed           | undaunted          | genuine
pragmatic     | trustworthy        | driven by a purpose| inclusive
not extraneous| forthcoming        | ready to serve     | conversational
              |                    | tireless           | caring
**Not:** Abrupt, arrogant, bossy, cold, critical, condescending.| **Not:** Overly complex, in the weeds, too much information, technical. | **Not:** Obligated, demanding, relentless. | **Not:** Superficial, gimmicky, overly casual.

**Tone** is the mood of the writing. The tone may vary based on the material’s content, the context, and the reader’s likely emotional state. For example, content on starting a vocational training program needs to have a more upbeat, encouraging tone, while content on burials needs a more gentle, compassionate tone.

## Voice
Balance the voice between friendly and formal — sound approachable and supportive. When possible, use first person (we, us, our) and second person (you, your) pronouns. Avoid judgmental or condescending language.

### Use person-first language

Don't put the label before the person     | Use person-first language
------------------------------------------| ----------
disabled and terminally ill policyholders | policyholders who are disabled and terminally ill
homeless women Veterans                   | women Veterans who are homeless

### Use plain language.

**Plain language uses:**
- Common, recognizable words that often have fewer syllables than their more complex synonyms (“help” rather than “assistance” and "happen" rather than "occur")
- Contractions (“don’t” rather than “do not”)
- Active rather than passive voice
- Shorter sentences and paragraphs
- Bulleted lists and bolded subheads to organize or “chunk” content in a clear, scannable way
- A conversational style, with questions in the first person (i.e., "How can I get these benefits?") and answers in the second person (i.e., "You'll need to apply for benefits").


Passive     | Active
------------| ----------
Most homeless services are run locally. | Local organizations run most homeless services.
All benefits decisions can be appealed. | You can appeal any decision VA makes about your benefits.


Keep sentences and paragraphs short.
  - Aim for sentences that are 15 words or fewer, but know that longer sentences are sometimes necessary.
  - Aim for sentences that have only 1 main message.
  - Use simple sentence construction (brevity wins!), and consider what information really needs to be included, for example:

Too wordy/too much information                                                 | Short and sweet

Disability compensation is a key benefit that helps Veterans. VA disability compensation provides monthly benefits to address the effects of disabilities, diseases, or injuries incurred during active military service. Some may not be apparent until years after you have completed your service. A disability can apply to physical conditions, such as chronic knee pain, as well as mental-health conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).| Do you have a lasting disability because you got hurt or sick during active service? You may be able to get monthly disability payments (benefits).<br /><br /><p>We offer benefits to help Veterans with different kinds of disabilities. You could have a physical problem, like knee pain that doesn’t go away. Or you might have a mental health condition, like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some disabilities may not develop until years after you finished your service.</p>

## Tone
Be careful about sounding harsh or intimidating. Even if you’re addressing a serious topic, plain language and a direct tone can convey the required seriousness without being overwhelming or confusing.

When filing your claim, you should submit evidence that the additional disability occurred as a result of VA medical care, or from participation in VA vocational rehabilitation or compensated work-therapy programs. The additional disability cannot be a reasonably expected result of or complication from treatment.| When you file your claim, you will need to give us evidence that you became more disabled because of VA medical care or another VA program, like job training or a work-therapy program.<br /><br /><p>If you became more disabled because of something that normally happens with treatment, like a side effect or common complication, you won’t be able to get these benefits.
