## Content Strategy
Doing is better than explaining. Content's main purpose should be to enable Veterans to complete a task—quickly and easily. We're constantly asking the question “what does a Veteran want to accomplish during this visit?”. Important things to consider:

- What is your service called, is that Veteran language or VA language?
- What paths might Veterans be taking to get to your service, how can you make it easy to find?
- Where might callouts to this new service on other webpages or websites make sense?
- How will this integrate into overall site navigation?

## Content Coordination
Writing is as important as any other part of your product's design, even the writing that exists outside of the product itself. There are other parts of Vets.gov that may be impacted by what you are working on.

## Content Resources
The Vets.gov Content Guide will help develop clear written orientation and instructions for your product, that is consistent with the rest of the site.

### Style Guides
> We follow the guidance and rules in the *[Chicago Manual of Style, 16th ed.] (http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html)* (CMS), and our dictionary of choice is [*Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary*](http://www.merriam-webster.com/) (M-W). The vets.gov Style Guide has exceptions to CMS and M-W, plain-language guidance (see Voice and Tone and Word Choice sections), a list of terms specific to VA and vets.gov, as well as government forms referenced on our site.
