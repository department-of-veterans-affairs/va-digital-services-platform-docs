## Introduction:

These words or phrases are not captured by, or run counter to, entries in Chicago Manual of Style or Merriam–Webster. Specifically, they:

- Have a different spelling or a different use of capitalization or hyphenation than what’s standard
- Surfaced during the concurrence process (e.g., say "VA claim exam" rather than "C&P exam"; say "decision notice" rather than "decision letter")
- List a plain-language example or usage
- Are VA-specific proper nouns (e.g., Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance. We need to be accurate about whether a term is capitalized, plural, singular possessive, plural possessive, etc.)
- Are specific to VA forms and applications (e.g., Prisoner of War appears on the 10-10EZ capitalized, but it is lowercased in CMS and M-W. For consistency, we want to match capitalization style in forms. We also want to be accurate when referring to the names of blocks that Veterans fill in on forms.)

### A

- accredited representative: Lowercase. (A trained professional trusted to help with VA-related claims) OR "You can get help from a trained professional trusted to help with VA-related claims. [Find an accredited representative]."
