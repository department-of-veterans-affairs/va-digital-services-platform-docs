# Criteria for what goes into the style guide

(Please email beth@thesocompany.com if you have a suggestion for the style guide.)

Sometimes vets.gov style or spellings are contrary to what's outlined in CMS or M-W. We capture these exceptions in the vets.gov style guide. For example, the "percentages" entry (go to "Style and Formatting" and look under "Numbers") states that we use the percent symbol (%) rather than spelling out "percent." This runs counter to CMS, and for good reason: We use this more technical style because we have many pages in the Disability section where we refer to disability ratings, which always use %. That's the way VA communicates with Veterans (e.g., a Veteran is considered 10% disabled, never 10 percent disabled). So instead of using the symbol when referring to disability ratings and then spelling out the word "percent" in other contexts, we decided to go for consistency and always use the percent symbol.

We have a long list of terms that either are not captured by, or run counter to, entries in CMS or M-W. Specifically, they:

- Have a different spelling or a different use of capitalization or hyphenation than what's found in CMS or M-W
- Surfaced and were clarified during the concurrence process (e.g., say "claim exam" rather than "C&P exam"; say "decision notice" rather than "decision letter")
- Are VA-specific proper nouns (e.g., Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance. We need to be accurate about whether a term is capitalized, plural, singular possessive, plural possessive, etc.)
- Are specific to VA forms and applications (e.g., Prisoner of War appears on the 10-10EZ capitalized but it is lowercased in CMS and M-W. For consistency, we want to match capitalization style in forms. We also want to be accurate when referring to the names of blocks that Veterans fill in on forms.)
