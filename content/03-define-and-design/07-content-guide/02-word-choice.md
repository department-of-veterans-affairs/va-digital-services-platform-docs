title: Word Choice
---
Always use common words that Veterans will understand. If a term may be unfamiliar but you need to use it, be sure to give a plain-language definition.

**Note:** Veterans aren’t the only ones visiting vets.gov — their spouses, children, and other family members may also be looking for information about VA benefits and services. Consider defining military jargon terms that may be familiar to Veterans, but not to their dependents.

There are 3 tables below that will help us make plain-language word choices. The first lists words to avoid in vets.gov communications. The second lists words to use sparingly. The third lists words that should be defined. If a word needs to be defined, do so the first time you use it on a web page or as part of a form. After you’ve defined the word, use it without defining it again.

If the definition is short, put it in parentheses next to the word it defines, for example:
"If you don’t agree with the VBA’s decision, you can appeal to the Board for a de novo (new look) review."

If the definition is long, define the word in a separate sentence, for example:
"If you can’t work because of a service-connected disability, you may be able to get the same benefits as a 100% disabled Veteran, regardless of your rating. This is called being individually unemployable."

In some cases, you may want to introduce your reader to a complicated word because they are likely to encounter it elsewhere. In those cases, you can treat the more complicated word as the “definition,” but use a simpler word throughout your communications.
