title: Review The Technical Capabilities
label: Review Technical Capabilities

How well does the design line up with the technical limitations uncovered in discovery? Are there parts of the design that need to be reconsidered due to technical issues? Is there additional back end development that needs to happen before the project can proceed?

- Does the order of the screens mean any changes to schema, or imply difficult data handling?
- Does any information need to be uploaded by the user? How will that uploaded information be stored/sent?
- Does the design have any unique scenarios that the Vets.gov Design Patterns doesnâ€™t cover yet?
- Can you submit structured data directly? Or do you need to create a PDF for submission? Both?
- Are any required backend services frequently (or predictably) unavailable? What kind of messaging to the user will you need?

Design and engineering have a lot of impact on each other. The team should be talking about these questions frequently as the design evolves. Document changes in the product outline or a Significant Decisions doc.
