## Applying feedback
After your feedback sessions itâ€™s important to look at it as a whole, and as a group. You may need to weight different or conflicting feedback to decide on the way forward. Be mindful that sometimes even explicit feedback (this should look like that) can be addressed by fixing underlying problems. Analyze the feedback looking for underlying patterns.
