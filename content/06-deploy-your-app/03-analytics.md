## Planning for Analytics in Design
This documentation outlines analytics considerations for the Vets.gov Google Tag Manager container and its Google Analytics account (UA-50123418-3) and is not specific to the DAP implementation.

All pages should include the Vets.gov Google Tag Manager container that has an identifier of GTM-WFJWBD.  In Dev and Staging, the container will automatically track activity to the Vets.gov Non-Production Google Analytics Property (UA-50123418-9). When the application is pushed to the live site, activity will be tracked to the Production Google Analytics Property (UA-50123418-3).

When planning, answering the following questions will guide your decisions in what interactions and key transactions should be tracked:
- What is the final step a user will take in their user experience?
- What steps in the user experience would you like to measure to understand progress and abandonment?
- What other user interactions, like Print or Save, are key to understanding veterans’ behavior?
- Are there navigation elements that will be added to the main navigation that will help you understand flow between areas of the site?

After you’ve selected the interactions you’d like to track, the next step is working with analytics to determine:
1. An implementation approach for Google Analytics event tracking and goal set up (ideally through dataLayer events)
2. Naming conventions for event tracking
3. Custom dimensions, which are user, session, or product traits, that you’d like to collect

## Google Analytics Account Access
The name.gov team has its own Google Analytics account with detailed metrics on its program.

To request access, email or DM the vets.gov analytics POC (currently Mina Farzad, mina@adhocteam.us or @minafarzad). You will need a Google account to be granted access.
- DSVA/USDS/VA members should provide either a Gmail account (preferably a work specific account) or their government email (if a Google Account has been associated with it)
- Ad Hoc members should provide their @adhocteam.us emails
- Other contractors should provide either their work email (if a Google account) or a work-specific Gmail account
- Read-only access will be provided to the product View(s) according to the person’s role.
- During Q/A, a new Data Studio dashboard will be created with placeholder charts. Once application is pushed live, the charts will populate.

## Pre-Launch Testing
- Once the configuration via the dataLayer and Google Tag Manager is complete, Analytics will send a Google Tag Manager preview link for you to ensure events are firing on the user interactions you identified in the Design phase.
- User interactions measured as Events and goals measured as Transactions will be added to a new Data Studio dashboard
