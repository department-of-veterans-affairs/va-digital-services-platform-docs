title: User Acceptance Testing
label: User Acceptance Testing
---
During UAT, real users test the product we are launching to make sure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios and can help us eliminate potential risks.

The entire team should be involved in this process, including design, research, engineering and product.  

## Things to consider:

1. Plan in advance!
2. Work with devops to figure out how you will be able to test.
3. Identity what you need to test and what type of user you need.  How many users are you looking to test with? What scenarios do you need to cover?
4. How and where are you going to test?  Is it in person?  Is it remote and will you use joinme to record? How long will it take?
5. Do you need to recruit on social media?  Can you work with research team to provide amount of money as a thank you gift?
6. Does the user need to do anything before the test? (Like create an account?) Is there anything you need to tell the user upfront? (Like they will have to enter their SSN, see PII, confidential information, etc.)
7. Where to look for users? Here is a running list of places we have gotten testers from in the past:
  - **Advisory Board**: DSVA has an advisory board which was started by Marina Martin, the previous CTO and Team Lead.  It is comprised of key stakeholders and VA champions who have helped us over the years, many of whom are Veterans.  To email this group, please work with StatOps Lead or Vets.gov Lead.
  - **Social Media**: If you can craft a few senteces about who you are looking for and what you need tested you can put this up on social media sites to try and get Veterans.  Facebook search different groups and ask the administrator to join or post or if it's public, post yourself.  You can also try on Twitter or on your personal Facebook page and ask others to share!
  - **ID.me**: ID.me has a huge network of Veterans and they post regularly on their social platforms.  You could reach out in the slack channel and ask if they would be willing to help.
  - **Ask the business owner or main stakeholder** on the project to help recruit.
  - **Martin Taylor**: Martin used to be in charge of VA Comms and is a big champion of our work.  In the past he has helped recruit Veterans for testing.   <Martin.Taylor@va.gov>
