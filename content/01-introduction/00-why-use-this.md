VA has made strides over the years modernizing the technology powering Veteran-facing tools. From paper to digital, from manual to automated processes, from data centers to the cloud. The challenge now is to take lessons learned across these modernization efforts and spread them to other parts of VA to expand capacity for scalable delivery of new features and provide a consistent online experience for users. Ultimately, VA is providing online tools to Veterans, Dependents, family members, and caregivers whose design, performance, and security are on par with the private sector.

In creating this playbook, we’ve had conversations with business owners, project managers, developers, researchers, and designers across VA. Current challenges designing, building, and deploying features became clear. The major takeaways that contributed to the platform and playbook solutions are:

- [Discovery takeaways]

- Have visibility into other VA projects (to increase collaboration, and reduce duplication)
- [validate / fill in based on Discovery pain points]
- Launch features with built-in monitoring, alerts, and analytics
- Reduce impact of Launch features with a modern code base, for easy iteration and adjusting?
- Launch features without causing downtime for users?
- Know what APIs are available to leverage in building new features
