When starting a project, it’s important to understand the problem your team is trying to solve. To develop this foundation we start by answering  a few basic questions.
- Who is the end user?
- What are they trying to achieve?
- How do they achieve this now?
- How do they describe the challenges they face?

Here is an example of how the answers to these questions can be put together to form a problem statement from the end user’s perspective:

> *As a Veteran, I want to be able to receive benefits and discounts that I’m entitled to with my Veteran status. Right now, I have to carry around my DD214 to prove my Veteran stature, but it’s risky to do so because it contains a lot of personal information that if I lost could be very bad.*

With a problem statement defined, it can be used to establish a solution hypothesis that answers the question - How create a user experience that solves this problem? This can look something like:

> *By letting Veterans apply for a Veteran ID Card on [name.gov], we can provide users with a simple way to prove their Veteran status without having to carry around their DD214.*

In the next section, you’ll find details into how to validate your hypotheses with users to ensure that your team has identified the right problem and are working toward the optimal solution.
