**This is a work in progress proof of concept documentation effort, not yet ready for use or external review.**

VA’s Veteran-facing Tools Playbook is a collection of resources for teams across VA to build online applications that help Veterans get the services and benefits they deserve. The resources here are designed to be mixed and matched in any way that best suits your project. For example,

If you’d like guidance on recruiting participants for user testing, [visit the Research section].
If you’d like templates for creating user-centered product requirements, [visit the Product Planning section].
If you’d like to use modern design patterns for a new product or features you’re building, [visit the Design System section].

And so on! Browse through the resources to see what might be helpful to you. Click a project phase in the menu on the left to get started, or search by keyword.

**If you’d like to build and deploy an application directly on the modern platform, you can find step-by-step instructions in the section, [Launch Your App on [name.gov]](link).**
